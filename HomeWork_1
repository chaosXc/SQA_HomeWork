Software quality assurance (SQA) consists of a means of monitoring the software engineering processes and methods
used to ensure quality.[citation needed] The methods by which this is accomplished are many and varied, and may 
include ensuring conformance to one or more standards, such as ISO 9000 or a model such as CMMI.
SQA encompasses the entire software development process, which includes processes such as requirements definition,
software design, coding, source code control, code reviews, change management, configuration management, testing, 
release management, and product integration. SQA is organized into goals, commitments, abilities, activities,
measurements, and verifications.

For my opinion SQA play an important role in software process. Thank for SQA our software can be used for long time.
