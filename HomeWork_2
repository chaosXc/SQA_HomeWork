  Testing is one of the most importance work in Software life cycle. 
  The good testing can let the software have more quality.
  The key points in testing is:
  1. Why: quality demonstration vs. defect detection and removal
  2. How: techniques/activities/process/etc.
  3. View: functional/external/black-box vs. structural/internal/white-box
  4. Exit: coverage vs. usage-based
  We all know that thank for testing software can be metrics. As a science must be metrics, software engineering be a really science.
